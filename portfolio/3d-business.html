                    <p>While I worked as an Auto Body Tech Assistant at Smith Boy's Garage, we had a problem. There were no mirrors that would go with the design that had been chosen for the International Scout 800 we were looking on. The Auto Body Technician found some Jeep mirrors that would look good on the Scout, but the mount for the mirrors was designed to fit the flat doors of a Jeep, rather than the rounded doors of the Scout. So, knowing I had some skill in 3D designing, he asked if I could custom design some mirror mounts for the Scout. I agreed and began working immediately.</p>

                    <p>After several months of working on that project, I finished the custom mirror mounts and 3D printed them. We mounted the mirrors and they worked perfectly. After that, I baagan my own business 3D printing mirror mounts for International Scout 800's. The design was a hit and many people began buying them. Unfortunately, when I left to serve as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, I had to discontinue my business.</p>
