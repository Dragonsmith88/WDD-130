                <h1>What is the Purpose of this Website?</h1>
                <p>My Portfolio website will be a good website for people to learn about my past work, personal business, and my personality. It will be divided into three sections. The first section will be all about me (my personality, hobbies, and college). The second section will be about my past work and experience. The third and final section will be about my personal 3D printing business. </p>
